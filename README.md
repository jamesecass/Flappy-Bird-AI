# Flappy-Bird-AI

A Reinforcement Learning agent trained to play *Flappy Bird* using PyTorch and a custom Pygame environment.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to play *Flappy Bird* from scratch. The agent observes game state (bird position, velocity, next pipe gap) and learns optimal actions over time.
